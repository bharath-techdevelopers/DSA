Introduction to the DSA using python
A data structure is a way to store data.
We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.
In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.
Primitive Data Structures :
                            These are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
Abstract Data Structures :
                          These are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
DSA contains main concepts:
                          1)Linked List
                          2)Stack
                          3)Queue
                          4)Tree
                          5)Graph
