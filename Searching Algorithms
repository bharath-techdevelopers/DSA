Searching algorithms are used to find specific elements within a data structure, such as an array, list, or database. There are several types of searching algorithms, each suited for different types of data structures and search requirements. 
Below is a categorized overview of the most common searching algorithms:
  1)Linear Search
  2)Binary Search
  3)Interpolation Search

1)Linear Search:
                Scans each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends.
                In this list can be unsorted or sorted
2)Binary Search:
                Divides the sorted list into halves and compares the target with the middle element, reducing the search interval by half each time.
                Here the list elements should be
                                                 -sorted
                                                 -no duplicates
3)Interpolation Search:
                      Interpolation search is an improvement over binary search for uniformly distributed datasets
                      Instead of dividing the search interval in half, it uses a formula to estimate the position of the target value, making it faster for some cases.
                      Here the list elements should be
                                                 -sorted
                                                 -no duplicates
